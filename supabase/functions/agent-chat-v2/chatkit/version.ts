// ChatKit Version - TypeScript equivalent of version.py

// Version is typically managed by package.json in TypeScript projects
// This file provides a consistent way to access the version
// For now, we'll use a static version that matches the Python package

export const __version__ = "0.0.0";

// In a real implementation, you might want to:
// 1. Read from package.json at build time
// 2. Or use import.meta.url to read version dynamically
// For now, keeping it simple
